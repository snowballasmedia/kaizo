Modification of Twinkle for some wikis on SnowballasmediA
## FAQ
### Why is called Kaizo
I'm not joking: The responsible for the modification (Emiliano) was thinking about what name to put and thought about those Super Mario Bros mods called Kaizo that are very difficult and chaotic, so because Twinkle is a gadget for clean vandalism, we suppose that you are cleaning chaotic edits, so... Kaizo!
